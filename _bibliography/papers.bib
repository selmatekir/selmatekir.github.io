abstract = {Counterfactual statements are examples of causal reasoning as they describe events that did not happen and, optionally, those events’ consequences if they happened. SemEval-2020 introduces the counterfactual detection (CFD) task and shares an English dataset. Since then, a set of datasets has been released in English, German, and Japanese as part of Amazon product reviews. This work releases the first Turkish corpus of counterfactuals (TRCD). The data collection process is driven by a clue phrase list of counterfactuals, mainly in the form of verb inflections in Turkish. We use clue phrase-based filtering to collect sentences from the Turkish National Corpus (TNC). On the other hand, half of the collection is subject to random word filtering to avoid selection bias due to clue phrases. After the human annotation process with an Inter Annotator Agreement of 0.65, we have 5000 sentences, of which 12.8\% contain counterfactual statements. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive baseline of transformer-based models by testing the effect of clue phrases, cross-lingual performance comparisons using the available CFD datasets, and zero-shot cross-lingual classification experiments using fine-tuning on the different combinations of the existing datasets. The results confirm that TRCD is compatible with the other CFD datasets. Moreover, fine-tuning a Turkish-specific model (BERTurk) performs better than the multilingual alternatives (mBERT and XLM-R). BERTurk is more robust to clue phrase masking. This result emphasizes the importance of a language-specific tokenizer for contextual understanding, especially for low-resource languages. Finally, our qualitative analysis gives insights into errors by different models.},

In this work, we build a new corpus of quotes and propose a new task, quote detection, as a type of span detection. We retrieve the quote set from Goodreads and collect the spans through a custom search on the Gutenberg Book Corpus. We measure unique vocabulary usage by a state-of-the-art language model and perform comparative statistical analysis against the Cornell Movie-Quotes Corpus. Furthermore, we run two types of baselines for quote detection: Conditional random field (CRF) and summarization with pointer-generator networks and Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART). The results show that the neural sequence-to-sequence models perform substantially better than CRF. From the viewpoint of neural extractive summarization, quote detection seems easier than news summarization. Moreover, model fine-tuning on our corpus and the Cornell Movie-Quotes Corpus introduces incremental performance boosts.",

abstract = {Identification of promoters, enhancers, and their interactions helps understand genetic regulation. This study proposes a graph-based semi-supervised learning model (GCN4EPI) for the enhancer-promoter classification problem. We adopt a graph convolutional network (GCN) architecture to integrate interaction information with sequence features. Nodes of the constructed graph hold word embeddings of DNA sequences while edges hold the Enhancer-Promoter Interaction (EPI) information. By means of semi-supervised learning, much less data (16%) and time are needed in model training. Comparisons on a benchmark dataset of six human cell lines show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (10% higher F1 score) and has the fastest training time (up to 3 times). Moreover, GCN4EPI’s performance on cross-cell line data is also better than the baselines (3% higher F1 score). Our qualitative analyses with graph explainability models prove that GCN4EPI learns from both text and graph structure. The results suggest that integrating interaction information with sequence features improves predictive performance and compensates for the number of training instances.}

ABSTRACT = {Over the last few years, there has been an increase in the studies that consider experiential (visual) information by building multi-modal language models and representations. It is shown by several studies that language acquisition in humans starts with learning concrete concepts through images and then continues with learning abstract ideas through the text. In this work, the curriculum learning method is used to teach the model concrete/abstract concepts through images and their corresponding captions to accomplish multi-modal language modeling/representation. We use the BERT and Resnet-152 models on each modality and combine them using attentive pooling to perform pre-training on the newly constructed dataset, which is collected from the Wikimedia Commons based on concrete/abstract words. To show the performance of the proposed model, downstream tasks and ablation studies are performed. The contribution of this work is two-fold: A new dataset is constructed from Wikimedia Commons based on concrete/abstract words, and a new multi-modal pre-training approach based on curriculum learning is proposed. The results show that the proposed multi-modal pre-training approach contributes to the success of the model.},

abstract = { In the field of software engineering, practitioners’ share in the constructed knowledge cannot be underestimated and is mostly in the form of grey literature (GL). GL is a valuable resource though it is subjective and lacks an objective quality assurance methodology. In this paper, a quality assessment scheme is proposed for question and answer (Q\&A) sites. In particular, we target stack overflow (SO) and stack exchange (SE) sites. We model the problem of author reputation measurement as a classification task on the author-provided answers. The authors’ mean, median, and total answer scores are used as inputs for class labeling. State-of-the-art language models (BERT and DistilBERT) with a softmax layer on top are utilized as classifiers and compared to SVM and random baselines. Our best model achieves 63.8\% accuracy in binary classification in SO design patterns tag and 71.6\% accuracy in SE software engineering category. Superior performance in SE software engineering can be explained by its larger dataset size. In addition to quantitative evaluation, we provide qualitative evidence, which supports that the system’s predicted reputation labels match the quality of provided answers. }

abstract = {Many text documents are spatiotemporal in nature, ie contents of a document can be mapped to a specific time period or location. For example, a news article about the French Revolution can be mapped to year 1789 as time and France as place. Identifying this time period and location associated with the document can be useful for various downstream applications such as document reasoning or spatiotemporal information retrieval. In this paper, temporal entropy with pointwise mutual information (PMI) is proposed to estimate the temporal focus of a document. PMI is used to measure the association of words with time expressions. Moreover, a word? s temporal entropy is considered as a weight to its association with a time point and a single time point with the highest overall score is chosen as the focus time of a document. The proposed method is generic in the sense that it can also be applied for spatial focus estimation of documents. In the case of spatial entropy with PMI, PMI is used to calculate the association between words and place entities. The effectiveness of our proposed methods for spatiotemporal focus estimation is evaluated on diverse datasets of text documents. The experimental evaluation confirms the superiority of our proposed temporal and spatial focus estimation methods.},

title={Sales History-based Demand Prediction using Generalized Linear Models},
abstractNode={It's vital for commercial enterprises to accurately predict demand by utilizing the existing sales data. Such predictive analytics is a crucial part of their decision support systems to increase the profitability of the company. In predictive data analytics, the branch of regression modeling is used to predict a numerical response variable like sale amount. In this category, linear models are simple and easy to interpret yet they permit generalization to very powerful and flexible families of models which are called Generalized linear models (GLM). The generalization potential over simple linear regression can be explained twofold: First, GLM relax the assumption of normally distributed error terms. Moreover, the relationship of the set of predictor variables and the response variable could be represented by a set of link functions rather than the sole choice of the identity function. This work models the sales amount prediction problem through the use of GLM. Unique company sales data are explored and the response variable, sale amount is fitted to the Gamma distribution. Then, inverse link function, which is the canonical one in the case of gamma-distributed response variable is used. The experimental results are compared with the other regression models and the classification algorithms. The model selection is performed via the use of MSE and AIC metrics respectively. The results show that GLM is better than the linear regression. As for the classification algorithms, Random Forest and GLM are the top performers. Moreover, categorization on the predictor variables improves model fitting results significantly.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
